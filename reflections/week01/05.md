# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? I think my mock design on thursday, and my clone site went well. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise? Using *{} to apply a style to everything or the debug feature is very helpful. 
- What are you struggling with? bootstrap nav bars and overriding settings
- What would you count as a victory? I completed and turned in the first checkpoint.
