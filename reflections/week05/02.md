## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?
one to one
one to many
many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`
linking - relation only exists as apart of the Schema
embedding - can retreive user and addrresses in one operation

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
It depends on how many categories you have in each. You can use two way embedding, one way embedding, or third embedding.
