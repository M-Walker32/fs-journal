## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
I feel like I havem't successfully written a many to many relationship in C# in my own work, which means the final will be the first time I've done it. You've provided good refrences, but I haven't had enough time to write and test the relatoinships on my own.
For time management, I plan on working in 1 hour to 1.5 hour increments with small breaks and a lunch. This weekend my goal is to finish the backend and get a basic start on the frontend. I want to feel comfortable that I could finsh by end of day Wednesday. 
I really enjoy the porject based learning style. I liked the  ability to apply the skills I learned and find ways to make it my own.
