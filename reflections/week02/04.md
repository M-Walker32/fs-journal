## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
Makign a plan helps prevent writing bad code. A plan helps you create structure. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
I start with just making a comment line and writing what I wnat to accomplish. For eaxample: "activate the function on click to start the timer". Then I try to break down what I know and figure out what I don't know using the refrenece code, mdn, or other resources. 

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
Think about what your're doing doing, plan it out, then code. This applies to startign a project and for writing individual fucntions.
