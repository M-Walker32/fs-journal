## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
Where you are able to use a variable. They can be global (used throughout the document) or local (like inside a function).
2. What is Hoisting ?
It takes the varibles and function declarations and moves them to the top. It then reads them before the rest of the function. 
3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
let- is used when you would like to update the variable. You can also use let insdie a block of code and chnge the scope to within that block. 
const- when you would like the value of the variable to remain the same
var- if you wanted a variable to change everywhere in your document anytime it's reassigned.
