## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
It is a class that chnages a state of an element. So far I only know how a Pseudo-Class would apply to links.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is the measurement of how specific something is. Whatever is most specific to an element is what the element will do. This means you can target items that need to be different and still use general styles.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
The important feature makes your code the most specific. If you use this for several styles, and then want to chnage them, you'll have to go into each individual instance and change it. Having all your styles in your CSS document and editing them there will be quicker adn more organized.
