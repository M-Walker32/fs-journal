# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? Learning more about javscript, the difference between arrays and dictioinaries and what mehtods you cna use with them. 
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise? How much pain a small syntax error can cause. 
- What are you struggling with? Learning javascript syntax
- What would you count as a victory? I completed the second checkpoint, i didn't over complicate the assignment and it went smoother then the daily assignments.
