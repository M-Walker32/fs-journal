## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
Primary keys are the unique ids on an object. A foreign key is a key that refrences the primary key. 
2. What is an `Alias`?
An alias is a shortened name of the data. They are used to condense code. 
3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
SELECT
d.*,
p.*
FROM doctors d
JOIN patients p ON p.id = d.patientId
