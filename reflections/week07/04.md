## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
We tried partner programming taking turns with the keyboard. I did some code documentation usign comments. If we left off somewhere for a break I always try to leave a comment of what I was tryign to achieve. 

2. What went well this week?
We completed the project, it looks pretty, and we passed. 

3. What would you do differently?
I would spend some time planning before jumping in to creating the backend. We made some mistakes in it that caused us to stuggle later in our frontend development.
