## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
Unit Testing -testing snibbits of code in isolation
Component Testing - testing your component and anything it relies on
End to End Testing - testing as the user

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
I think end to end testing, because in the END the application is built for the user and your ghoal as a developer is to make your app a good experience for the user. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
It's hard to argue that testing anything in code is less useful. If my units of code don't work, then my component won't work and my app will suck. I feel like they build off of each other. The 'least useful' will chnage depending on what step your on. If you've beeen coding for three minutes then end to end won't be very useful.
