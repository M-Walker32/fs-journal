## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

By beginning your design by laying out the containers, rows, and coulmns, you save yourself from diving in to deep before you have the structure laid out. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I feel like the resources are pretty endless here. Good design is al over the webs, social media, ect. Googling color palettes is a good way to up your design. 

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
A good design makes a website more accessible. It's like going into a store and everything is located where you'd think it be. Bad design makes you shut your computer and avoid whatever task you were suppose to complete.
