## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
Communication on any size team helps fill in gaps and make sure everyone on the team is on the same page. The right amount of communication helps the team work together and be more effective. 
2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
Meetings can be condensed and other tools can be used to communicate, like slack. When need team members can have one off meetings that are more focused on the individuals tasks. 
3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
A product cannot be cheap, fast, and good. One has to be traded for another. Do you wnat a good app fast - then you'll need to pay the mega bucks. If you just wnat a cheap app fast, be ready for a lack in quality.
