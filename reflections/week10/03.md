## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
A columns holds all the same data type like names, ages, descriptions. A row hold each new object. So my charcter named Oaul is 5 years old and looks like an old man would go accross the row. Reading down the name column you'd read Paul, Saul, Raul?.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS charcaters(
    id INT NOT NULL primary key AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    age TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
) default charset utf8;
3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
Drop Table will delete the entire table and everything inside it, and if you want to make something using that table you'll have to make a new one. 
if you use Delete from you can make sure whatever your deleeting in the table meets a certain condition.
