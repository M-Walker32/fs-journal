## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
An enum tells a property that it must equal one of the matching strings pre determined. We used them in our capstone to denote colors. In AllSpice they could be used for the recipe categories.

2. How can you modify an Enum?
In the projects I've made enums were always selcted using a drop down button of some sort, and then passed through the service as an edit like you would send an edit to any object. 

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
I have used them for checkpoints like task master. We used them on our capstone project for a color selector, sinc eI don;t trust the user to selct colors.
