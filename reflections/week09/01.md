## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We are doing a daily standup to start each day. We are using chart.js to draw graphs based on our habits data. We started a bug wall to keep track of things that still need to be fixed.

2. What went well so far?
We are doing a good job of switching up roles and partners. Our daily standups have helped us define our goals for each day. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?
We do our best work before lunch, the afternoons are typically not as productive. A standup after lunch helped, but we weren't consistent with it.
